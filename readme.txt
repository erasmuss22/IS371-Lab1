Lab1

In my lab I made a couple deviations to help the user enter data. In all exercises, I made
it so asterisks would appear next to each input area that had an error in it. I also made
sure to include warning labels for improper formating if the user formated some data
incorrectly. Finally, I implemented a confirmation system for Exercise 1 so the user
could get a second chance to see any input mistakes they made. I feel like this was the
only situation for this to get used since the program was creating a user id.
